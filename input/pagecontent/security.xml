<h3 id="requirements">General Security Requirements</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, all interfaces implementing these profiles shall be considered as containing Protected Health Information and as such shall implement the adequate security mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>These security requirements are usually defined by the parties that will interoperate.</strong></p>
<p>For example, when exchanging data with the regional data vaults, systems shall comply with the security mechamisms defined and implemented for those vaults. A different example is when the exchange is between two systems inside a hospital, and in this case the security mechanisms will be defined by the hospital.</p>
<p>While rules can be defined locally, it is expected that any system implementing these profiles will not present a point of failure or weakness.</p>
