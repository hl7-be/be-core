description: "This is the Logical Data Model for Communications. Communications can
  be:\r\n\r\n* Messages between healthcare professionals\r\n* Messages between professionals
  and the patient\r\n* A journal of notes and communications about a patient, a patient's
  care or a healthcare team's activities.\r\n\r\nThis Logical Data Model is compatible
  with both FHIR Communication and KMEHR Diary Note, namely the selection of attributes
  that are supported, and the maximum length of the payload (320 characters)."
jurisdiction:
- coding:
  - system: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm
    code: '001'
purpose: This logical model can be instantiated in the technical standards that are
  used in Belgium - KMEHR and FHIR. This ensures semantic compatibility between systems
  and standards.
